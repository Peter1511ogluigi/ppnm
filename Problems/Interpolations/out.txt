We note that our integrator works, since

The integral of the interpolant            from x[0] = 0 to z = 11 is         = -0.971902
The integral of cos(x) (from math.h)       from        0 to     11 using GSL  = -0.99999
The integral of cos(x) (from WolframAlpha) from        0 to     11            = -0.99999

this can also be seen from the plot given in lin_spline_plot.png.
