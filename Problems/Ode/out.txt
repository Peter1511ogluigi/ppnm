We solve for u''=-u, with solution cos(x).
 Therefore we have y(0)=1.
For this, the start vector is 
   1.00001 
-0.000371198 

After 2 pi we get the following vector
   1.00001 
-0.000371198 

The analytical answer is
         0 
        -1 

This took 338 steps

Now er try to use the SIR model to plot the evolution of corona in Denmark.
We choose the following parameters N=6e+06 I=3200 R=226000 and investigate the development over 75 days
The plot is shown on the figure Epidemic.png, which resembles the plot from the SIR wiki page.It took 276030 steps to attain the plot with Tc=1/2
when comparing different Tc's we see that the larger Tc the more the solution is
shifted to the right and the number of infected decrease.
this makes sense since given the definition of Tr/Tc
