- - - - Exercise A - - - - 

we check integral of 1/exp(1-x) from 0 to pi
numerical result 8.14687 +- i0.00217403
This is the same as found on wolfram alpha.

We now check the sought after integral from the exercise and get
numerical result 1.39298 +- i0.00373311
corresponding to the result given in the exercise.

- - - - Exercise B - - - -

In this exercise we need to 'Implement a multidimensional Monte-Carlo integrator
 that uses low-discrepancy sequences.'
and
Compare the scaling of the error with pseudo-random Monte-Carlo integrator.
The comparison can be seen on plot.png where it is clear that the error
becomes smaller with greater number of points.
